# NetSentry
NetSentry keeps track of how much data is transferred over each network interface available to your Android system.

The current release is [NetSentry-1.2.1](https://github.com/lorenzfischer/netsentry/blob/master/release/1.2.2/netsentry.apk). You can also find this link on the [release notes](https://github.com/lorenzfischer/netsentry/blob/master/doc/releasenotes.md) page.
Main features include:
Tracks the data transmitted over all active network interfaces.
Notifies you about medium and high network usage through the Android notification facility.
You can specify different transmission limits for every interface, so you can setup the amount of data that your carrier's price plan lets you transmit for free.
You can schedule optional automatic resets on a daily or monthly basis.
Technical features:

Does not depend on having a service running on your device, which is good if you care about your battery ;-)
Automatically restarts after a system reboot (when you turn off your phone).
Does not wake your phone up when it is sleeping.
It's free!
.. and opensourced, so you can browse through the code ;-)
