# Help Page for NetSentry #

**The two main screens:**

The Interface List:<br />
This screen lists all active network interfaces. An interface is considered "active" if data has been transmitted over it. Therefore, your device might actually have even more network interfaces than listed in that view, but they're inactive.

The Interface Details Screen:<br />
Selecting an entry from the list gives you detailed information about how much data has been transferred over that particular interface. In addition to that you can reset the data counters, specify a transmission limit for the interface, or schedule automatic resets for the data counters.


**Miscellaneous information:**

Updates:<br />
When you open _NetSentry_ all data counters will be updated. Automatic updates are scheduled on a regular basis. You can set the update interval using the preferences.


Notifications:<br />
Notifications will pop up only during automatic updates. All notifications will be cleared as soon as you open _NetSentry_.
